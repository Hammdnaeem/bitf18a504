  <h1> Version Control System</h1>
  
  <h2>What is gi0t?</h2>
  
  <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
     Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. 
     It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Git Clone Command</h2>
	 <p>git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. ... Cloning a local or remote repository. Cloning a bare repository. Using shallow options to partially clone repositories.</p>

		<h2>Git add command</h2>
		<p>The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .</p>

  <h2>Merge Conflict</h2>
  <p>A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge commits without your help.</p>

  <h2>Git commit Command</h2>
 <p> The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of git commit, The git add command is used to promote or 'stage' changes to the project that will be stored in a commit. These two commands git commit and git add are two of the most frequently used.</p>

   <h2>Git push Command</h2>
 <p>  The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches. Remote branches are configured using the git remote command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing. These issues are discussed below.</p>

  <h2>Git fork command</h2>
  
 <p> Forking is a git clone operation executed on a server copy of a projects repo. You create a new feature branch in your local repo. Work is done to complete the new feature and git commit is executed to save the changes. You then push the new feature branch to your remote forked repo.</p>

  <h2>Git branch Command</h2>
  <p>Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.</p>
